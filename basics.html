      BASIC PHOTOGRAPHY

      Aperture: In optics, an aperture is a hole or an opening through which light travels. More specifically,
      the aperture and focal length of an optical system determine the cone angle of a bundle of rays that come
      to a focus in the image plane.

      In photography, the aperture stop of a photographic lens can be adjusted to control the amount of light
      reaching the film or image sensor. In combination with variation of shutter speed, the aperture size will
      regulate the film's or image sensor's degree of exposure to light.

      The following example is how actually the aperture effects a photograph:

      Shutter speed: Shutter speed is the length of time your camera shutter is open, exposing light onto the
      camera sensor. Essentially, it’s how long your camera spends taking a photo. This has a few important
      effects in how your images will appear.

      When you use a long shutter speed, you end up exposing your sensor for a significant period of time. The
      first big effect of shutter speed is motion blur. If your shutter speed is long, moving subjects in your
      photo will appear blurred along the direction of motion. This effect is used quite often in advertisements
      of cars and motorbikes, where a sense of speed and motion is communicated to the viewer by intentionally
      blurring the moving wheels.

      ISO: In very basic terms, ISO is simply a camera setting that will brighten or darken a photo. As you increase
      your ISO number, your photos will grow progressively brighter. For that reason, ISO is a good tool to help you
      capture images in dark environments or be more flexible about your aperture and shutter speed settings.

      However, raising your ISO has consequences. A photo taken at too high of an ISO will show a lot of grain, also
      known as noise, and might not be usable. So, brightening a photo via ISO is always a trade-off. You should only
      raise your ISO when you are unable to brighten the photo via shutter speed or aperture instead (for example, if
      using a longer shutter speed would cause your subject to be blurry

      FOCAL LENGTH: Focal Length and Angle of view. The focal length of the lens is the distance between the lens and
      the image sensor when the subject is in focus, usually stated in millimeters (e.g., 28 mm, 50 mm, or 100 mm). In
      the case of zoom lenses, both the minimum and maximum focal lengths are stated, for example 18–55 mm.
